# Artificial Intelligence Project
This project was the final project of our AI course during the first year of Robotics Engineering. 
This is my first real project with Python, and it's a good way to practice in one of the most use language. 
I did this project in collaboration with Enrico Casagrande and Alessandro Grattarola
